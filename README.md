*Structure:*
"Commands" folder contains the commands we used to run the tools for collecting the data.

"Configurations" folder contains two folders, it contains the configurations of Code Coverage and Mutation Testing respectively.

"Data_After_re-processing" folder contains 5 different folders named after 5 projects, in each of these folders it has the data after re-processing, which is used to do the data analysis.

"Raw_Data" folder contains 5 different folders named after 5 projects, in each of these folders it has the raw data we got from the project.In "Metric(1,2,4)" folder, you can find the index.html in the folder, which you can see the raw data of code coverage and complexity from it.In "Metric3" folder, you can do the same way as above to see the raw data of Mutation Testing. For the Metric5, we provide with the screenshot to record our raw data. For the Metric6, because we manually detected the post-release bugs of different versions so we can only provide with the table which is used to record Metric6.

*Requirements:*
////////////this is for the requirement of data collection////////

For the script used to do the data analysis, you need to download R Console to do the work.
